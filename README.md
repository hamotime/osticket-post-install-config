<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This tutorial outlines the post-install configuration of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />




<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (22H2)

<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

- Configure Roles (Allows us to group permissions)
- Configure Departments (Allows us to create ticket visibility to org departments)
- Configure Teams (Allows us to group agents from different departments into teams)
- Allowing anyone to create tickets
- Configure Agents (The help desk workers)

- Configure SLA (Service Level Agreement, in this context how much time you have to do a specific task)
- Configure Help Topics (Categories to choose from when creating a ticket)

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
For this lab I will be navigating between Admin and Agent Panels. Just wanted to give an explanation here of what the differences are. The "Admin Panel" allows to configure settings for osTicket on the backend and the "Agent Panel" is for the help desk worker when they are working tickets. Ok lets proceed.
</p>
<br />

<p>
1. Configure Roles <br />
 Login to the Help Desk login page with credentials created previously http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php. <br />
 Select Admin Panel (Top right) -> Agents -> Roles -> Add new Role
